# Overview

The goal of this course is to help the students for the _[Red Hat Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation exam (EX407)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex407-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-ansible-automation-exam)_.

We will setup a test environment with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). This environment will simulate a  network like the following table:

| Hostname | Group | IP |
|:---------|:------|:---|
| control.ansible.loc | control | 192.168.33.100 |
| web1.ansible.loc | webservers | 192.168.33.10 |
| web2.ansible.loc | webservers | 192.168.33.20 |
| proxy.ansible.loc | proxy | 192.168.33.30 |
| database.ansible.loc | database | 192.168.33.40 |

Then we will show some commons exercises and practical examples that you can use to try your hand at to test your knowledge.
